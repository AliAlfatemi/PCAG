# Patient Subgrouping using Multiomics Data on Grassmann Manifold

## Description:
A comprehensive approach to identifying patient subgroups with distinct survival rates by leveraging multiomics datasets, namely, microRNA, gene expression, and DNA methylation. This project showcases:

- Integration of heterogeneous big data into intrinsic structures.
- Dimensionality reduction via PCA.
- Graph construction for patient data.
- Data embedding using the Grassmann manifold for patient clustering.
- Extensive testing on datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).

By integrating these varied datasets on a Grassmann manifold, our method outperforms conventional methods in clustering accuracy and survival rate prediction, paving the way for precise and personalized medical treatments.
