# PCAG  
We have added introduction for the code, which is shown as follows: First, we normalized the data, then we utilize the PCA technique to diminution reduction. After that, we constructed the graphs for each data type. Then, We projected all the graphs into low-dimensional subspaces and obtained their associated embedding in these spaces and marging them on grassmann and used K-means algorithm for clustering.  
The main code: GrassMann_Fold_Total_Cleaning.m.
